# openCv_screenAnalzyeToPlayTheGame
### What is this project?
This is project that analyzes what is on the screen (by image procesisng with OpenCv) to play game

### Why was it created?
When I was reading about OpenCV library and possibility to process and analyze images I had not real need to use this in any real project.
However, it looks fun enough to test it and check how it works, so me and my friend decided to challenge each other.
We had some website game that had simple rules and that challenges human reflexes and decided to try get the best score with this bot.

Me and my friend separatelly tried to learn how OpenCV works and how the game was working to check which of us will make better job.

### Any other information?
The game that we was trying to play with this bot is aviable here: https://salagier.pl/gry/magazyn-rudego/ but it is written in way that
requires similar devices for each "challenger" because speed of timer scales with f.e. FPS and resolution of monitors so i really reccomend 
treat is lightly and only as "funny project" because the same piece of code could get absolutely different effectiveness with other hardware 
due to implementation of the game itself.
